    -> Edited the .l .y files to add the let and symbol into our grammar

    -> created new functions linkSymbolNode, addToSymbolTable, createSymbolTableNode, makeNewSymbol, findSymbol, evalSymbolNode

    -> tested the sample input that was given on the myCi wesite.

    -> successfully ran the inputs and got satisfying results.



    Task3:

        -> I added keywords double and int and made the necessary changes in the .y and .l files

        -> extended the number of parameters that createSymbolTableNode function would take so that
            i can take the user nput and make the necessary changes

        -> i checked and compared the types of the user inputs and the declared type

        -> created a preccision warning if a user inputs something like  ((let (int a 1.25))(add a 1))
